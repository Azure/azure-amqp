## What to contribute
There are many ways that you can contribute to the Microsoft Azure AMQP for C# project:

* Submit a bug
* Submit a code fix for a bug
* Submit additions or modifications to the documentation
* Submit a feature request

## Contributing Code
To contribute code you need to issue a Pull Request against the develop branch. All code submissions will be reviewed and tested by the team, and those that meet a high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

## Big contributions
If your contribution is significantly big it is better to first check with the project developers in order to make sure the change aligns with the long term plans. This can be done simply by submitting a question via the GitHub Issues section.
